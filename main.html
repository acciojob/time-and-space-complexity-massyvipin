	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity in computer science refers to a way of measuring how the execution time of an algorithm changes as the size of its input grows. It provides insights into the efficient and scalability of algorithms.</p>
	<p>The amount of memory required by the algorithm to solve given problem is called space complexity of the algorithm. The <b>space complexity</b> of an algorithm quantifies the amount of space taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input.</p>
