	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to execute as a function of the input size. It’s a crucial concept in computer science and helps us understand how efficient an algorithm is. When designing algorithms, we aim for low time complexity to ensure fast execution. An efficient algorithm typically has a time complexity that grows slowly with input size, such as O(log n) or O(n). By analyzing time complexity, we can make informed decisions about which algorithm to use for a given problem.</p>
	<p><b>Space complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses as a function of the input size. It’s a critical factor in determining how efficiently an algorithm utilizes memory resources. When analyzing space complexity, we consider how the memory requirements grow relative to the input size If an algorithm allocates additional memory that scales linearly with the input size (i.e., proportional to n), we express its space complexity as O(n).</p>
